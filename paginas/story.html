    <p class="parrafo_main_story"> Okabe Rintaro is an eccentric college student who dreams of conspiracy and chaos.
      Adopting the persona of a mad scientist, he spends his time developing oddball gadgets with his friends in their
      makeshift laboratory. <br>
      One day, they accidentally discover that one of their inventions can send emails into the past. In other words,
      they have created a time machine. <br> <br>

      SERN, John Titor, the IBN 5100, the Butterfly Effect, and the 11 theories of time travel, when chance brings these
      elements together in Akihabara, Japan, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. <br> <br>
      What will Okarin choose when he holds the future in his hands?</p>

        satellite
        crashed into Radio Kaikan.<br> Then, thousands of people vanished from the streets of Akiba. <br>
        Finally, Makise Kurisu came back to life just three hours after I found her dead.<br> I know this doesn't
        make sense, but it's all true!”</p>

        “It all went to hell because of me, but I have a time machine. I can set things right.<br>
        I can bring her back.
        So resolved, I set out to change the past, only to find that failure awaits me at every <br>
        turn. No matter what I do, the result is always the same, as if the universe itself wants <br> it to happen.”
        <br>
        There has to be a way. <br> <br>
        The protagonist performs innumerable jumps in time to undo the d-mails that he sent <br>
        to the past that caused great changes in the future, one of them...The third world war!
